# Obesity Data Preprocessing and Analysis

## 📘 Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature encoding on the **Obesity Dataset** to prepare it for machine learning applications such as obesity level classification.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Category Encoders  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Visualization of key features (Age, Weight, Height, BMI)  
3. Computation of BMI feature  
4. Encoding categorical variables (Ordinal and One-Hot Encoding)  
5. Exporting the cleaned dataset to Excel (`obesitydataset_v1_pre.xlsx`)  

## 📊 Results
The processed dataset is ready for training classification models to predict obesity levels based on lifestyle and demographic factors.

## 📁 Output
`obesitydataset_v1_pre.xlsx` — Final processed dataset.
